//! The launchpad: every program the Start menu lists, a screen of tiles at a time, and the search written in at its
//! head.
//!
//! It is Glance's own window, as the dock is (see `crate::dock`): one window over the screen it opens on, its glass
//! frosted over what is behind it, drawn by the panel's thread. It never holds the focus but while it is up, and gives
//! the keys back as Esc is pressed, or as one of its tiles is opened (see `crate::ui::keys`).
//!
//! What it shows is read as it comes: the shell's list of programs, and the picture of each as the shell gives it,
//! a thin glyph set on a plate of its own colours as on a Mac's (see `crate::station::thumbs::plated`), a tile of
//! its name's first letter till then. Pressing a tile opens what it is; pressing
//! its right button opens it, opens it with the administrator's leave, fixes it to the dock, or shows where it is.
//! Carrying one tile onto another merges them into a folder, which is pressed open and stood in again, named, and
//! taken apart (see `crate::settings::LaunchFolder`).
