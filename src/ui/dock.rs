//! The dock's shape and its painting: where its tiles are along the row, and how they are drawn. No window, no
//! pointer, nothing running — those are the dock's own (see `crate::dock`).
//!
//! A tile the pointer grows near swells where it stands and leans over its neighbours, rather than pushing the whole
//! row along with it. The row is laid out once, at rest, and never moves: what the pointer does is to change how big
//! each tile is drawn in the place it was given. So the tile under the pointer is the tile under it at the end of the
//! swell too, and a press lands where the eye says it will — which a row that shifted under the hand never does.
//!
//! What is drawn and what is taken for a press are therefore the same tiles, in the same order: the least swollen
//! drawn first, the most last, over the rest. A press belongs to the last of those that cover it.
//!
//! The glass is measured as the row lies, and never changes while the dock is up: what the pointer swells rises out of
//! its top, past its edge, as the tile leans over its neighbours. The window is shaped to take the pointer over that
//! overflow as well, so a tile is pressed where it is seen even where it has left the glass behind.
