//! The dock's window: a row of tiles along the foot of a screen, or its top, never taking the focus. Each opens a
//! thing kept at hand, one of Glance's own doors, or the Recycle Bin; a dot under a tile says its program is
//! running, and pressing such a tile goes to its window rather than opening another copy of it. The pointer swells
//! the tile it passes (see `crate::ui::dock`), locked it stays where it was put, and auto-hidden it goes off the
//! edge till the pointer comes back to it.
//!
//! Like the overlay it is two windows: one as large as the glass and the room its tiles swell into, which takes the
//! pointer and shows nothing, and one larger still by the shadow's room, which shows it all and lets every click
//! through. The glass itself is never resized by what the pointer does to the tiles, so nothing moves out from under
//! the hand while they swell.
//!
//! It is drawn by the panel's thread, as the overlay is: at every sample, as the pointer moves over it, and as its
//! swell eases out or it slides in.
